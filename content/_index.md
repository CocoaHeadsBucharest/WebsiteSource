CocoaHeads Bucharest is a community for the iOS developers in Bucharest. It's for people interested in native iOS development, as well as tvOS, watchOS and also macOS.

We organize meetups where people in the community give talks about trending topics in iOS development. If you want to give a talk about a particular subject, contact us. 

Our main way of communication is our **[meetup](https://www.meetup.com/CocoaHeadsBucharest/) page**. That's where we announce the new events. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CocoaHeadsBuch) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CocoaHeadsBucharest) are great means of spreading the word and announcing new stuff, but Meetup will be our main channel of communication.

**We are currently planning our first event, which we hope to announce in the second part of October 2017.**
