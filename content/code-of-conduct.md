**All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our gatherings are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code, both in online group forums such as Slack, and throughout IRL events.**

**TL;DR: Be nice, be considerate, be respectful.**

Our community must provide a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, class, disability, gender identity, physical appearance, race and ethnicity, religion and belief, sexual orientation, preferred operating system, programming language, or text editor. 

A gathering shall be considered a 'safe space' where no-one is disadvantaged or discouraged from contributing, as long as they respect othersâ€™ ability to contribute. All members must be respectful and considerate of the contributions of others.

Discriminatory or harassing language and imagery are not appropriate for any part of our gatherings, including talks, workshops, Twitter, Slack, and other online forums. 

**A more explicit list:**

Unacceptable behaviors include harassing, abusive, discriminatory, or derogatory conduct. Harassment includes: offensive comments; inappropriate use of sexual images; deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

**Sanctions:**

**People violating these rules will be asked to leave the meetup and/or any future meetups, including group forums such as Slack, at the discretion of the organisers and those raising a concern.**
